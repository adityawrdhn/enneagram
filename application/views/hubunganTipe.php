				<p class="animate-onscroll">Understanding is the key to having compatible, fulfilling relationships—this includes both understanding others and yourself.The Enneagram personality typing system can provide you with profound insights and practical tools that will improve your relationships with everyone in your life. This applies to marriage, friendships, and professional relationships—to everywhere people interact.</p><br>

				<p class="animate-onscroll">
				Each personality type thinks differently, has different values and approaches, and wants different things in a relationship. Some types have more elements in common with each other (for example, two Positive Outlook types or two Withdrawn types); however, with the lens of the Riso-Hudson Enneagram, the strengths and trouble spots can be specified for each combination of the nine personality types.
